     * cbf:                Callback function. If not null, this function is called periodically

     * user:               Context for use by the callback receiver.

     *                     frames have been consumed from track input buffer.
     * sessionId:          Specific session ID, or zero to use default.
     * threadCanCallJava:  Whether callbacks are made from an attached thread and thus can call JNI.
